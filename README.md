opengl-aux
==========

opengl-aux is a collection of auxiliary OpenGL functions and types for working with the opengl-core gem. It includes simple wrappers around existing OpenGL types such as buffer objects, vertex array objects, and program objects as well as simplified functions for retrieving the extensions list, glGet without the use of pointers, and other niceties.

Examples
------------

See sample code in `examples/triangles.rb`

Contributing
------------

Want to contribute to the development of opengl-aux? Need something wrapped that isn't already wrapped? You can contribute either by creating issues on or submitting pull requests for changes on the [opengl-aux GitHub page][GitHub]. Welcome changes include anything from usability questions to bug reports and fixes to additional or improved GL object wrappers.

[GitHub]: https://github.com/nilium/opengl-aux

Specific areas where opengl-aux is lacking include documentation, examples, and GL object wrappers. As of this writing, there are only programs, shaders, textures, buffers, and vertex array objects -- they comprise the majority of what you'll do, but a somewhat Ruby-like interface for everything would eventually be welcome.

The only major requirement for code contributions is that you agree to license your contribution under the same license as opengl-aux (shown below). Aside from that, if you have any questions, feel free to create an issue.
